## Notes

The main challenges for building this site were implementing new features using the concepts introduced to me during the prework. Since I was unfamiliar with most of the functions explained in the PDF's it did take a little longer for me to learn how to use them. For example, both the 'reduce' and 'filter' methods were new to me so I had to set aside extra time to make sure I understood them. That said, these learning moments actually became the most enjoyable parts of the process, and encouraged me to continue working on it to add optional features.
